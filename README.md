## 💡 Why Job Application Crew?

✅ Most resume tools are one-shot, shallow, and generic.  
✅ This system thinks like a team:
- One agent extracts job needs.
- Another understands your background.
- A third refines your project descriptions.
- A fourth connects the dots to deliver a strategic, keyword-optimised resume.

It’s the power of multi-agent systems applied to real-world productivity — smarter, faster, and more strategic job applications.
